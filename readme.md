# HyperMon
Pokemon Gen 1 (Red, Blue, Yellow) engine re-creation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

HyperMon will be a (hopefully) faithful recreation of the first generation of Pokemon Games.  It's a challenge to see if I can do everything using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Oh, because I hate myself a lot, I'm challenging myself to see if I can't make it all work within the DOM.  Like, no `<canvas>`.  Just the DOM.



I'm not insane.  *You're* insane.
